### **The Big Idea**

In a competitive luxury automotive market, understanding the drivers of revenue and the pace of growth is critical. This project synthesizes five years of BMW global sales data to answer three core questions:

1. **Are we hitting our targets?** (Executive KPIs)
2. **Which models and regions fuel our success?** (Product & Market Mix)
3. **Where is the momentum carrying us?** (Growth Trajectory)

**The Result:** A 360° narrative of a premium brand that generated **$3.52bn in revenue**, with the final two years alone accounting for nearly **50% of all units sold**.

* **So What?** Prioritize X3 electrification for mass-market capture while protecting X6 exclusivity to defend high-margin territory.

#### **3. Regional Performance – The "Popularity Map"**

* **Insight:** North America leads with **22.93%** of unit volume; Europe and Asia follow to round out two-thirds of total sales.
* **So What?** Focus high-intent digital spend in North America while strategically expanding dealer networks in emerging African and South American markets.

#### **4. Year-over-Year Trends – The "Growth Trajectory"**
